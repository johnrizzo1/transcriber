# AI Voice Agent Requirements

## Overview

A local, real-time voice interface for interacting with an AI agent that can execute tools and actions on behalf of the user. The system enables natural voice conversations while maintaining complete privacy by running entirely on-device. The agent should be extensible with various tools and capabilities to assist users with tasks through natural language commands.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Real-time Speech Recognition**
   - Convert spoken audio to text with minimal latency (<300ms)
   - Support continuous/streaming recognition
   - Handle interruptions and overlapping speech

2. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
   - Detect when user is speaking vs silence
   - Enable barge-in/interruption detection
   - Minimize false positives from background noise

3. **AI Agent Integration**
   - Process transcribed text through local LLM with tool calling
   - Support streaming responses for lower latency
   - Maintain conversation context and state
   - Execute tools and actions based on user intent
   - Provide feedback on tool execution status

4. **Text-to-Speech Output**
   - Convert AI responses to natural speech
   - Support streaming synthesis
   - Enable interruption of ongoing speech

5. **Audio-Text Synchronization**
   - Align transcribed text with audio timestamps
   - Enable synchronized playback of conversations
   - Store conversation history with timing data

6. **Tool Integration Framework**
   - Extensible plugin architecture for tools
   - Standard interface for tool registration
   - Async tool execution with progress feedback
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Tool permission management

7. **Built-in Tool Categories**
   - System tools (file operations, process management)
   - Development tools (code execution, git operations)
   - Information tools (web search, knowledge queries)
   - Productivity tools (calendar, reminders, notes)
   - Home automation (when available)

### User Interface

- Command-line interface (CLI) for initial version
- Voice-first interaction (minimal typing required)
- Real-time transcript display with tool execution status
- Visual feedback for agent state (listening, thinking, executing)
- Commands: start, stop, replay, export, list-tools, configure

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **End-to-end latency**: <500ms (from speech end to response start)
- **Audio quality**: 16kHz minimum sample rate
- **CPU usage**: Runnable on consumer hardware (4-8 core CPU)

### Privacy & Security

- **100% local processing**: No external API calls
- **No data transmission**: All processing on-device
- **Configurable data retention**: User controls conversation storage

### Compatibility

- **Platform**: macOS (initial), Linux and Windows (future)
- **Python**: 3.10+ required
- **Hardware**: 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended

## Technical Constraints

### Must Use Local Components

- **STT**: faster-whisper or Vosk Python (no cloud APIs)
- **TTS**: Piper TTS Python bindings (no cloud APIs)
- **LLM**: Ollama Python client with tool-calling models (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5)
- **VAD**: Silero VAD Python or py-webrtcvad (local only)
- **Agent Framework**: LangChain/LangGraph Python or custom async implementation
- **Tool Runtime**: Python subprocess with resource limits

### Architecture Constraints

- Modular design for component swapping
- Streaming pipeline for low latency
- Thread-safe audio processing
- Efficient memory management for models
- Plugin-based tool architecture
- Secure tool execution sandbox
- Event-driven communication between components

## Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Graphical user interface
- Multi-speaker recognition
- Voice cloning/customization
- Cloud backup/sync
- Mobile applications

## Success Criteria

1. Achieve <800ms round-trip conversation latency (including tool execution)
2. Maintain >95% speech recognition accuracy in quiet environments
3. Support natural conversation flow with interruptions
4. Run entirely offline after initial setup
5. Use <4GB RAM during operation (excluding LLM)
6. Successfully execute 90% of tool requests without errors
7. Provide clear feedback for tool execution status
8. Support at least 10 concurrent tool integrations
