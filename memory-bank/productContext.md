# Product Context: AI Voice Agent

## Problem Statement
Users need an intuitive, private way to interact with AI assistants that can perform actions beyond simple conversation. Current solutions require cloud connectivity, lack privacy, or have high latency that breaks conversational flow.

## Solution Vision
A **voice-first AI agent** that runs entirely on local hardware, enabling:
- Natural conversation without typing
- Instant responses with <800ms latency
- Complete privacy with no data transmission
- Extensible capabilities through tools
- Professional-grade reliability

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Voice Assistant**: Natural conversation for information and tasks
2. **Development Helper**: Code execution, git operations, file management
3. **Productivity Tool**: Notes, reminders, calculations, text processing
4. **System Controller**: File operations, process management, system info

### Interaction Flow
```
User speaks → Real-time transcription → AI processes → Tools execute → Voice response
```

### Key Experience Principles
- **Conversational**: Natural speech patterns, not command-based
- **Responsive**: Immediate feedback and low-latency responses
- **Interruptible**: User can stop AI mid-speech with new input
- **Contextual**: Maintains conversation history and context
- **Reliable**: Graceful fallbacks when components unavailable

## Target Users
- **Developers**: Need hands-free coding assistance and system control
- **Privacy-conscious users**: Require local processing guarantees
- **Productivity enthusiasts**: Want voice-controlled task management
- **Accessibility users**: Benefit from voice-first interfaces

## Competitive Advantages
- **100% Local**: No internet required after setup
- **Low Latency**: Sub-second response times
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom tools
- **Open Source**: Full transparency and customization
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows

## Success Indicators
